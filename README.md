Initially I wanted to develop a text-based game set in 2034 dystopian world.
But when I started theorizing it, I realized that I can develop a tool capable of developing REST APIs for different text-based games.

This thing is very early in development, but I hope that I will have time to finish it, since developing it is very fun C:
Might even create a UI for making utilizing this thing convenient, I hope. I cope.
